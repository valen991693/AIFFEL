### 5. Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews

* We tackle sentiment analysis, a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves classifying sentiments in text.

* We utilize embedding techniques like Word2Vec and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

* * *

### 6. Text Summarization (Seq2Seq)

* We employ the Seq2Seq model for document summarization, which involves the concepts of encoder-decoder architectures.

* * *

### 7. cGAN (Pix2Pix)

* We explore generative adversarial networks (GANs) by applying them to a project like coloring Pok√©mon images.

* This project marks our foray into image generation models, where we actively utilize tools like Gradient Tape.

* * *

### 8. Transformer

* We delve into the Transformer model, one of the hottest deep learning models in the field. We may explore text generation tasks such as building chatbots from scratch using Transformers.

* * *

## Exploration Learning Objectives

* The exploration phase aims to perform various tasks and toy projects related to deep learning, helping us discover our interests and develop a passion for deep learning.

* While understanding the models is crucial, grasping the flow of each project becomes even more important. Although the tasks and data may differ from data analysis projects to Transformer projects, the general flow remains consistent.

* Once we understand the project flow, we can then delve into studying the models in detail.

* The above content represents the description of the repository, which has been refined to showcase a well-organized summary of the author's work.
