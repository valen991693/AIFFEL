#### Process

1. Defining Objective: Classifying Legendary pokemon and ordinary pokemon

2. Data collection
    - making copy

3. Missing data

4. Checking data (understanding entire columns)
    - Understanding entire columns (basic EDA)
    - Clarifying differences (advanced EDA)
          Total value
          Name

5. Preprocessing
    - Tokenizing
    - One-Hot Encoding

6. Model - Decision Tree
    - Training with original data
    - Training with preprocessed data

* Metric - “Recall” (of True)

#### Dataset - pokemon.csv

> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abcsds/pokemon

* This data set includes 721 Pokemon, including their number, name, first and second type, and basic stats: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed.

* With certain types you can also give a geeky introduction to machine learning.

* These are the raw attributes that are used for calculating how much damage an attack will do in the games. This dataset is about the pokemon games (NOT pokemon cards or Pokemon Go).

The data for this table has been acquired from several different sites, including:

* pokemon.com
* pokemondb
* bulbapedia
